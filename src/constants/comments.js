Her design is truly innovative, combining both patient needs and a striking design into one. The impact on my operations have been for the better on all sides: my staff are excited to come to work in a refreshing environment filled with natural light, and my patients are happy to experience a space that reflects the kind of innovative, quality care we hope to provide.
